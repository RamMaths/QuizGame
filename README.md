This a random project to train my react and css skills, i am starting this from scratch. I just came up with this idea while i was checking [this](https://publicapis.dev) site which basically has a bunch of public APIs that we can use, I found a Trivia API and I decided that might be a good idea to create a game based on this API just to train my skills. [API Link](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

It's not finished of course, i will be updating everything till it's finished. Now I am focusing on implement the functionality then I will move on to the css.

- [x] React
- [x] Tailwind css
